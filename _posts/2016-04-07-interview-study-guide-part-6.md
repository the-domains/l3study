## 6\. Being Able to Troubleshoot Common Applications

### Can you troubleshoot Apache, MySQL, Exim, etc...?

You need to know where the logs are. AT LEAST THAT. If you can, try to get experience for what can be found in them. Familiarize yourself with their messages, errors, format, etc.

nginx, is not required, but if you want to give yourself a better chance at being "chosen". ;-) Try to familiarize yourself with it. Whatever you can do will be better than nothing.

#### Apache

* Known how to start/restart/stop apache service
* Know where the logs are located
* Be able to read the logs

#### MySQL

* Know where the logs are located
* Be able to read the logs

#### Exim

* Not really given any instruction here from any candidates as to what we need to know
* **Know how to read email logs**
> 
>   * For example: This is SpamAssassin in the mail tail logs -- R=virtual\_sa\_user T=virtual\_sa\_userdelivery
>   * Do we need a separate mail logs document that can be referenced here?
